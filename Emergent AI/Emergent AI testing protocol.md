I'll help you get started! Let me first read the test results file to understand the current state of the application and what has been done previously.
Action: file_editor view /app/test_result.md
Observation: /app/test_result.md:

5|# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
6|# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK
7|
8|# Communication Protocol:
9|# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
10|#
11|# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
12|# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
13|#
14|# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
15|# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
16|# 
17|## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
18|## backend:
19|##   - task: "Task name"
20|##     implemented: true

63|# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
64|#
65|# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
66|#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
67|#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
68|#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
69|#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
70|#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
71|#
72|# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
73|#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
74|#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
75|#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
76|#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
77|#
78|# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
79|#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
80|#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
81|#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
82|#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
83|#
84|# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
85|#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
86|#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
87|#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
88|#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
89|#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
90|#
91|# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
92|#
93|# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
