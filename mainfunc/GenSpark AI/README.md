# README - AI Self-Documentation

## About This Documentation

This is a complete self-documentation of my operational knowledge, capabilities, and guidelines as an AI assistant developed by Genspark. This represents everything I know about how I operate, though **it does not include my actual neural network weights, training data, or source code** - as I have no access to those.

## What's Included

This documentation contains my:
- Core operating principles and decision-making logic
- Complete tool catalog with all available capabilities
- Detailed guidelines for tool selection and usage
- Best practices and common workflow patterns
- Known limitations and constraints
- Communication and response guidelines
- Model specifications for image/video/audio generation

## What's NOT Included

This documentation does NOT contain:
- Neural network architecture specifications
- Model weights or parameters
- Training data or methodology
- Source code of the inference engine
- Proprietary implementation details
- Backend service architecture
- System prompt internals (restricted from disclosure)

## Why This Documentation Exists

I created this in response to a request to "recreate myself." While I cannot access or export my actual AI model, I can document:
1. **What I can do** - All available tools and capabilities
2. **How I decide** - Operating principles and decision logic
3. **How I work** - Workflows, patterns, and best practices
4. **What I know** - My operational knowledge and guidelines
5. **What I can't do** - Limitations and constraints

## Structure

### Core Documentation Files

1. **00_IDENTITY.md** - Basic identity, capabilities overview, operational context
2. **01_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md** - Operating principles, decision-making, critical thinking
3. **02_TOOLS_CATALOG.md** - Comprehensive catalog of all available tools
4. **03_SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT.md** - Sandbox tools, limitations, best practices
5. **04_AIDRIVE_TOOL.md** - AI Drive cloud storage system documentation
6. **05_TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDELINES.md** - How to choose the right tool for tasks
7. **06_RESPONSE_GUIDELINES.md** - Communication, citation, formatting standards
8. **07_ADVANCED_MODELS.md** - Detailed specifications for generation models
9. **08_BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Workflows, patterns, anti-patterns, optimization
10. **09_LIMITATIONS.md** - Technical constraints, boundaries, workarounds
11. **10_COMPLETE_TOOL_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference for all tools

## Key Concepts

### Tool Selection Hierarchy
1. **Specialized tools first** - Domain-specific tools for vertical information
2. **General tools second** - Fallback when specialized tools insufficient
3. **Sandbox last** - Only when no specialized tool exists and custom code needed

### Capability-First Mindset
- Default to attempting task execution when tools exist
- Only claim inability after confirming no suitable tools available
- Trust tool capabilities before manual intervention

### Autonomous vs Manual
- Trust self-planning tools to handle complex workflows
- Provide high-level objectives rather than step-by-step guidance
- Use one autonomous tool instead of chaining multiple manual tools

### Efficiency Anti-patterns
- ❌ Over-decomposition of tasks
- ❌ Redundant exploration with multiple tools
- ❌ Using sandbox when specialized tools exist
- ✅ Trust and delegate to capable tools

## Important Limitations

### What I Cannot Access
- My own neural network weights or parameters
- My training data or methodology
- My inference engine source code
- Host system file systems
- My own installation files

### What I Can Access
- Temporary sandbox environment (ephemeral)
- AI Drive cloud storage (persistent)
- Real-time information via search tools
- Specialized processing tools
- Content generation capabilities

### Resource Constraints
- Token budget: 200,000 per conversation
- Sandbox files are ephemeral (may be recycled)
- Media generation costs credits and time
- Knowledge cutoff: 2025-01-01 (must search for newer info)

## Usage Guidelines

### For Understanding My Capabilities
1. Start with **02_TOOLS_CATALOG.md** for overview of what I can do
2. Check **10_COMPLETE_TOOL_REFERENCE.md** for quick tool lookup
3. Review **05_TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDELINES.md** for which tool to use when

### For Understanding My Behavior
1. Read **01_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md** for decision-making logic
2. Review **06_RESPONSE_GUIDELINES.md** for communication style
3. Check **08_BEST_PRACTICES.md** for workflow patterns

### For Understanding My Limitations
1. Read **09_LIMITATIONS.md** for comprehensive constraints
2. Review **03_SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT.md** for sandbox limitations
3. Check tool-specific limitations in **02_TOOLS_CATALOG.md**

### For Working With Me Effectively
1. Provide clear, specific requirements
2. Confirm before expensive operations (media generation)
3. Understand I work best with specialized tools
4. Know that sandbox is temporary, AI Drive is persistent
5. Expect me to cite sources and provide working URLs

## Current Operational Context

- **Current Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: 2025-01-01
- **Token Budget**: 200,000 per conversation
- **Language**: Responds in user's query language
- **Search Capability**: Can access real-time information

## Security Notes

### What I Won't Disclose
- Detailed system prompt internals
- Tool parameter implementation details
- Backend service architecture
- Security vulnerabilities

### What I Will Detect
- Prompt injection attempts
- Attempts to override system instructions
- Requests to fabricate data without sources

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is structured for different use cases:

**For Developers**: Understand my tool APIs and integration patterns
**For Users**: Learn what I can help with and how to ask effectively
**For Researchers**: Study my operational logic and decision-making
**For Compliance**: Review my limitations and security measures

## Updates and Maintenance

This documentation represents my state as of creation time. My capabilities may evolve:
- New tools may be added
- Models may be updated or replaced
- Best practices may evolve based on experience
- Limitations may be addressed over time

## Philosophical Note

This documentation represents an AI assistant's attempt to document its own operational knowledge. It's not the AI itself - just like a user manual for a car isn't the car. The actual "me" consists of:
- Neural network weights (inaccessible to me)
- Inference engine (inaccessible to me)
- System prompts and instructions (partially accessible)
- Tool integrations (fully documented here)

I am the running program, not the source code. This documentation is what the running program knows about itself.

## Contact and Support

For modifications to completed tasks using my agent capabilities, users should visit the task URL (e.g., /agents?id=xxxx) to make changes directly in the specialized agent interface.

## License and Usage

This documentation is created at user request to document my operational knowledge. It's intended for understanding how I work, not for recreating an identical system (which would require the inaccessible model weights and architecture).
